Crystal Game

This was a fun one. The initial logic wasn't too tough to come up with. jQuery makes it a lot easier to assign the values that the math functions created earlier in the code. Had a little fun with bootstrap and some regular css to dress things up a bit. Hopefully, it isn't too visually overwhelming, but I wanted to make something that was bright and fuin and goofy, and I think I succeeded. 

I had a bit of trouble adding wins and losses without them concatening. I was using the wrong method to add them to the HTML and, eventually, settled on an object literal as the most efficient way of ascribing the values. I also had a tough time with the game running before there was any user input. A click() seems to have alleivated those issues, though. 

In the future, I'd like to dress up the jumbotron a little more. It also isn't entirely optimized for mobile, but a media query that shrinks the crystal images would probably do the trick.
